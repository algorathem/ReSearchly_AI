## About
ResearchlyAI is an AI-powered research assistant that streamlines the entire research workflow. Ask a question and it fetches trusted sources, scores their reliability, and explains why so you get ideas you can trust.

The center pane allows you to interact with each source, digesting complex papers without reading every word. Curious about replicating experiments? Our explainer agent provides step-by-step instructions including pseudocode.

Finally, draft your conclusions in the report editor with dark and light modes for comfort. Powered by the Motia framework, ResearchlyAI unifies APIs, workflows, and AI agents into a seamless backend solution for smarter research.
